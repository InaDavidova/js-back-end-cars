# js-back-end-cars
 This is a backend application built with **Express.js**, **Handelbars** and **Mongoose**. It was made for educational purposes only. It has **users**, who are able to create car advertisements and attach accessories to them when logged in. The creator of an ad can **edit** and **delete** it. The users that are not authenticated are only allowed to browse and see the details for an ad. **Search** and **pagination** were also implemented.
 
 In order to start the project you need to run `npm install` and `npm run start`. After that you can open it on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) .
